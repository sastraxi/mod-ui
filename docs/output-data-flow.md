# mod-host Output Data Flow

## Overview

mod-host continuously produces two kinds of feedback on its read socket (port 5556):

- **`output_set`** — real-time meter/scope values (audio level, parameter outputs)
- **`param_set`** — state changes: bypass toggles, parameter edits, MIDI-learn assignments

These share the same socket and the same flow-control mechanism.

## The `data_finish` / `output_data_ready` Handshake

mod-host batches one frame of output data, then signals the end:

```
mod-host                    mod-ui (host.py)              WebSocket clients
    |                            |                               |
    |-- output_set inst A ------>|                               |
    |-- output_set inst B ------>|-- output_set inst A --------->|
    |-- param_set X :bypass 1 ->|-- output_set inst B --------->|
    |-- data_finish ------------>|-- param_set X :bypass 1.0 --->|
    |                            |                               |
    |                            |-- data_ready N -------------->|
    |                            |                               |
    |                            |<-- data_ready N --------------|
    |                            |   (browser echoes back)       |
    |<-- output_data_ready ------|                               |
    |                            |                               |
    |  (next frame unlocked)     |                               |
    |-- output_set inst A ------>|                               |
    ...
```

**`output_data_ready` is the unlock signal.** Until mod-ui sends it back to mod-host,
mod-host will not produce the next frame. This means `param_set :bypass` echoes (and
all other feedback) stall if `output_data_ready` is never sent.

### mod-ui side (`host.py: process_read_message_body`)

```python
if msg == "data_finish":
    if self.web_connected:          # any WebSocket client is open
        self.web_data_ready_ok = False
        self.web_data_ready_counter += 1
        self.msg_callback("data_ready %i" % counter)
        # Start a 150ms fallback timer in case no client acks in time.
        # msg_callback sets web_data_ready_ok = True if it self-acknowledged,
        # so the timer is only armed when a real ack is still outstanding.
        if not self.web_data_ready_ok and self.last_data_finish_handle is None:
            self.last_data_finish_handle = ioloop.call_later(0.15, self.send_output_data_ready_later)
        return
    else:
        yield gen.Task(self.send_output_data_ready, now)   # no client: use timer
```

### Client echo path (`session.py: ws_data_ready`)

```python
def ws_data_ready(self, counter, ws):
    ws._meter_ready = True
    # Guard: if the 150ms timer already fired, web_data_ready_ok is True —
    # skip to avoid sending a second output_data_ready to mod-host.
    if self.host.web_data_ready_counter == counter and not self.host.web_data_ready_ok:
        self.host.web_data_ready_ok = True
        self.host.send_output_data_ready(None, None)
```

### `send_output_data_ready` (`host.py`)

```python
def send_output_data_ready(self, now, callback):
    self.web_data_ready_ok = True   # mark as done before sending
    ...
    self.send_notmodified("output_data_ready", callback)   # write socket → mod-host
```

`web_data_ready_ok` is set here (rather than only in `ws_data_ready`) so that if the
150ms timer fires first, any subsequent browser ack is a no-op.

## Local Client Optimization (`_is_local`)

pi-stomp connects from `127.0.0.1`; browsers connect from LAN IPs.
Local clients don't need meter spam, so `msg_callback` skips `output_set` and
`data_ready` for them (`session.py: websocket_opened` sets `ws._is_local = True`).

**Problem:** if all connected clients are local, `data_ready` is sent to nobody,
nobody echoes, and `output_data_ready` is never sent to mod-host → everything stalls.

**Fix (`session.py: msg_callback`):** when `data_ready` was suppressed for every
connected client, self-acknowledge immediately — mirroring what a real browser echo
would do:

```python
if is_data_ready and not any_non_local_received:
    self.host.web_data_ready_ok = True
    self.host.send_output_data_ready(None, None)
```

## Backgrounded Browser Tabs (`_is_background`, `_meter_ready`)

A Chrome tab in the background throttles its JS timers to ~1 Hz. Without mitigation,
one backgrounded tab stalls the entire meter loop: it receives `data_ready N` but
doesn't echo for ~1 second, blocking `output_data_ready` and all `param_set` echoes
(including footswitch feedback to pi-stomp).

Two mechanisms work together to prevent this.

### Explicit visibility signal (`_is_background`)

When the browser page becomes hidden, the JS `visibilitychange` listener sends a
WebSocket message:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', function () {
    if (ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        ws.send(document.hidden ? 'client_hidden' : 'client_visible')
    }
})
```

`webserver.py` sets/clears `ws._is_background` on receipt. In `msg_callback`, a
client with `_is_background = True` is skipped for both `output_set` and `data_ready`:

```python
elif is_output_set:
    if getattr(ws, '_is_background', False) or not getattr(ws, '_meter_ready', True):
        continue
elif is_data_ready:
    if getattr(ws, '_is_background', False) or not getattr(ws, '_meter_ready', True):
        continue
    ws._meter_ready = False
```

When all non-local clients are skipped this way, `any_non_local_received` stays
`False` and the self-acknowledge fires immediately — zero added latency.

When `client_visible` arrives, the server sets `_is_background = False` and
`_meter_ready = True`, and the client re-enters the normal handshake on the next frame.

### Per-client pending-ack gate (`_meter_ready`)

Each client carries a `_meter_ready` flag (default `True`). It is cleared when
`data_ready N` is sent to that client, and restored when the client echoes back.
A client with `_meter_ready = False` is skipped in `msg_callback`, the same as a
backgrounded client.

This covers a gradual slowdown that doesn't trigger `visibilitychange` (e.g., a
foreground tab under heavy CPU load that is simply lagging its echo).

### 150ms fallback timer

`_is_background` relies on the browser sending `client_hidden` before the next
`data_finish` arrives. This is not guaranteed: there is a race between Chrome's
`visibilitychange` event and mod-host's next frame. To bound the worst case,
`host.py` arms a 150ms timer after each `data_ready N` dispatch, but only when
`web_data_ready_ok` is still `False` (i.e., `msg_callback` didn't self-acknowledge):

```
t=0      data_ready N sent to Chrome, timer armed for t=150ms
t=50ms   Chrome (foreground) echoes back → ws_data_ready clears timer, output_data_ready sent
t=150ms  timer fires only if Chrome hasn't echoed → output_data_ready sent, stall bounded
```

150ms is chosen to be safely above Chrome's 50ms JS echo debounce (`triggerDelayedReadyResponse`),
so the timer never races a foreground ack in normal operation. When `client_hidden` is
working, the timer is never armed (self-acknowledge fires in `msg_callback`).

### Double-send protection

Both `send_output_data_ready` and the `ws_data_ready` echo path converge on the same
send. The `web_data_ready_ok` flag prevents a second `output_data_ready` from being
sent if both fire in the same IOLoop turn:

- `send_output_data_ready` sets `web_data_ready_ok = True` before sending.
- `ws_data_ready` checks `not web_data_ready_ok` before calling `send_output_data_ready`.

## Why the Browser Throttles

The browser JavaScript delays its echo by 50 ms before sending `data_ready` back
(`triggerDelayedReadyResponse` in `host.js`). This caps the `output_set` update rate
at ~20 fps, preventing DOM update starvation on pedalboards with many parameters.
Each new `data_ready` resets the debounce timer, so only the most recent counter is
ever echoed.
